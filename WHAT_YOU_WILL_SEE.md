## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### Visual Check
Look at the airfoil shapes. You should see:
- ✅ Some thin (sleek, sharp)
- ✅ Some thick (bulky, rounded)
- ✅ Some curved up (high camber)
- ✅ Some curved down (reflex)
- ✅ Some smooth (clean curves)
- ✅ Some wavy (undulations)

### Console Check (F12)
Look at the console output. You should see:
- ✅ Different types: "Thin Sharp", "High Camber UAV", "Reflex Camber", etc.
- ✅ Different thicknesses: 7.2%, 18.4%, 11.2%, etc.
- ✅ Different cambers: -1.3%, 14.7%, -7.8%, etc.
- ✅ Different point counts: 287, 342, 256, etc.

### Badge Check
Look at the type badge (top right of visualization). You should see:
- ✅ Badge text changes with each generation
- ✅ Shows different airfoil family names
- ✅ Updates immediately after clicking generate

Generation 9: Eppler
Generation 10: NACA 5-digit
```

### Thickness Distribution
```
Thinnest:  5.8%  ← Ultra-thin
Thickest:  21.3% ← Very thick
Range:     15.5% ← Wide variety
```

### Camber Distribution
```
Most Negative: -9.2%  ← Reflex
Most Positive: +16.4% ← High-lift
Range:         25.6%  ← Extreme variety
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Watch the Console
The console shows exactly what's being generated:
- Airfoil type
- Thickness percentage
- Camber percentage
- Point count

### Tip 2: Compare Shapes
Generate 2-3 airfoils and compare them side-by-side (take screenshots)

### Tip 3: Look for Extremes
You should see:
- Very thin airfoils (< 8%)
- Very thick airfoils (> 18%)
- Reflex camber (negative)
- High-lift camber (> 12%)

### Tip 4: Check the Badge
The badge is the quickest way to see what type was generated

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: How many clicks before I see variety?
**A:** You should see obvious differences after just 2-3 clicks!

### Q: Will I ever see the same type twice?
**A:** Yes, but with different parameters. Each type has wide parameter ranges.

### Q: What if I see similar shapes?
**A:** Generate 10+ airfoils. Statistical variation means some may look similar, but the overall set will show dramatic variety.

### Q: How do I know which type is which?
**A:** Check the type badge (top right) or console output.

### Q: Can I download all the different types?
**A:** Yes! Click "Download .dat" after each generation.
